improving our um.
* We made use of the Bitpack interface made by Comp40 staff

## Analysis of Hotspot Assembly Code
- In our final submission, most operations and Bitpack operations are made
inline, but for the sake of finding the hotspot, we removed the static inline
keyword temporally.
- Identified hotspots using kcachegrind to be Bitpack_getu - taking up roughly
80% of the total run time.
- Analyzed callers and callees
- Looked at assembly code, realized there are a lot of conditionals and jump
statements and move statements that take up the majority of the time
- Traced the jump statements back to asserts and shl/shr.
- The conditional jumps in shl/shr are in fact optimizing the operations by
making the least number of bit shifts.
- Conclusion: this section of the code, although a hotspot, should not be
changed because 1) without the assert statements, we don't have the
necessary safeguards and thus would not have a complete program and
2) the shl/shr if check for edge cases that actually reduce the average runtime
and thus the total instructions even though the function is longer.
3) We've minimized the number of times that we execute Bitpack_getu - we only
unbitpack the necessary parts for a given operation.
